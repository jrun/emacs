Magit v2.10.3 Release Notes (unreleased)
========================================

Changes since v2.10.2
---------------------

* The new command `magit-do-async-shell-command' opens file at point
  with `dired-do-async-shell-command'.  "&" is now bound to this
  command.  #2992

Fixes since v2.10.2
-------------------

* `magit-bisect-run' now uses a shell to run the command entered in
  response to the "Enter shell command" prompt.  #3001

* Discarding a renamed file failed if the original file was within a
  directory that no longer existed.  #2998

* When inserting information about a rebase in progress into the
  status buffer, "exec" lines were treated as a commit, leading to an
  error.  #3002

* `magit-blame' failed in blob-visiting buffers if the corresponding
  file no longer exists in the HEAD or the index.
